I found the learning styles article very interesting. I think it is a very widespread notion that there are different types of learning styles which is something that I believed myself. I think that they make a really good point about how individual students donâ€™t have a full understanding of what learning techniques will work better and are proven by research to work better on a whole. The statistics about how the different learning strategies do not actually affect test scores surprised me. I think that it makes a lot of sense that the more researched methods by professionals would have more of an impact on learning. I still do think that there are certain methods for individuals that can help them understand concepts better, but on the whole, learning has overall methods that can help everyone.
