The lecture was very casual in the build-up, yet very inspiring. He brings you along on a journey from his childhood dreams, to his impact on those around him and their dreams. The backstory of this man and his lecture added a lot of underlying emotion to it. The fact that this was his last lecture because he knew he was dying of cancer makes what he is saying all the more important. He knows this and we as an audience know it as well. He is bringing all of his life experience to the audience. I found it interesting that the entire audience seemed to be made up of an older crowd, yet the advice seemed to be meant for a younger audience. It seems to speak more to those in the young adult crowd who are on the verge of leaving childhood and starting to chase their dreams in action. The advice for how to live your life can of course be applied to everyone, yet as someone who is facing this, it seems to stick harder. This being said, of course I can relate. I understand the feeling of having those childhood dreams seem to slip away as priorities change and reality gets harder. I feel like this lecture was a very good reminder that we do not have to let go of those dreams and that we can still achieve them if we don’t forget them. There were many other themes about karma and attitude as well that all contribute to the success of one’s life, even though that will not look the same for everyone. He was very thoughtful, funny, and insightful. The lecture did have a deeper meaning about life and it has left an impact on me, and I’m sure many others who have listened.
